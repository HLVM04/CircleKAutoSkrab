Automatic scratching for CircleK Skrab
Hosten on: http://www.autoskrab.dk/

This is probably against the rules of CircleK Skrab, but I made it for fun anyways.

Works on the newest CircleK scratch campaign: **CircleK Juleskrab 2020**

This bot uses the requests python library to communicate with the CircleK skrab api.

**Commandline commands:**

-scratch (Scratches all numbers in file)

-add <phone_number> (Adds phone number to file, requires sms code)

-remove <phone_number> (Removes phone number from file)

-showNumbers (Prints all numbers in file)
